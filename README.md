# philtv-js

**philtv-js** is a TypeScript library for pairing and consume a Philips Android TV with the latest versions (6) using the **JointSpace** protocol.

This library simplifies the pairing process, allowing you to interact with your Philips television securely and efficiently.

With full TypeScript support, `philtv-js` provides type safety, helping to prevent runtime errors and improve code quality.

This library leverages the lightweight [urllib](https://www.npmjs.com/package/urllib) HTTP client, which is built on top of Fetch API, for making secure and intuitive HTTP requests.

**Works only in secure environments (HTTPS) and with versions 6 of the [JointSpace protocol](https://jointspace.sourceforge.net/projectdata/documentation/jasonApi/1/doc/API.html).**

## Key Features âœ¨

- Build with TypeScript, no python, but inspired by https://github.com/eslavnov/pylips
- Pairing process (programmatically and CLI)
- Many endpoints available. But we need to add more.
